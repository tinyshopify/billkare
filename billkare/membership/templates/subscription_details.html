The new status will start at the time pf the change. For example, a customer signed up the basic membership on Aug 5th, and he upgraded his membership on Aug 12th, so he used 7 days of his basic membership. The refund will be 6.99 * (1-7/30). </li>

                    <li class="mt-3">If a premium member chooses to downgrade his/her membership, the new basic membership wonâ€™t start until it expires next month, thus there is no refund in this scenario. </li>
